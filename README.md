## <a name="project-description"></a> Project Description
The Bike Dashboard project is an Excel-based data visualization tool that provides insightful metrics and visual representations of bike-related data. It demonstrates various Excel functionalities such as data cleansing, using IF and nested IF statements, creating a working sheet to preserve the original data, understanding column representations and data, removing duplicates, creating charts, and utilizing Find and Replace for data clarity.

**The project involves the following key steps:**
1. **Data Cleansing:** The original data is cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Column Understanding:** Each column's meaning and the data contained within it are explained to facilitate better comprehension.
3. **Removing Duplicates:** Duplicate entries in the data are eliminated to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.
4. **Find and Replace:** To enhance readability, certain column values are replaced. For example, "M & S" in the Marital Status column represents "Married & Single," while "M" and "F" in the Gender column are replaced with "Male" and "Female," respectively.
5. **Age Bracket Creation:** A new column is created to collapse the age data into specific brackets. IF and nested IF statements are utilized to categorize the age data accordingly.
6. **Dashboard Creation:** The project includes three initial dashboards that display the analyzed bike-related data.
